Compile YCM with a specific verion of python which is installed via pyenv

# Install python with pyenv

To compile YCM, the python must be installed with `--enable-shared` option enabled. By default, pyenv doesn't install python with this option on, so you need to tell pyenv that we need it:


    $ CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared --with-system-expat --with-system-ffi" pyenv install 2.7.11


# Install and Compile YCM

1.  Install YCM with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (or [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#about)). I prefer to use `vim-plug`, simply add the following line to your `vimrc` file or `init.vim` file if you use neovim instead.

2.  Before compiling you have to install `cmake`.

3.  Here, we assume you installed YCM with `vim-plug`, the default YCM directory is in `~/.config/nvim/plugged/YouCompleteMe` for neovim users.
    Create new folders for building YCM.

        $ cd ~
        $ mkdir ycm_build
        $ mkdir -p ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir

    For support C-family languages autocomplete, you have to download the binary distribution of LLVM+Clang from [llvm.org](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html), and extract to `~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir`

    Then run the following command in `~/ycm_build` directory:

        $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" \
          -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.11/include/python2.7 \
          -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.11/lib/libpython2.7.so \
          -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir . \
          ~/.dot/nvim/plugged/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp
        $ cmake --build . --target ycm_core --config Release
